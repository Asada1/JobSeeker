# JobSeeker
Automated email sender.


Simple console app, first created to send CV here and there, but you may use it for daily business mailing as well.
Console menu with two options: 
- to send a standard email to various receivers;
- to send different messages to each receiver;

You need to set up three files (I used simple 'txt' format, but you may redo the code and use .csv or whatever you need):
- 'receivers' - a list of receivers
- 'subject'/'subjects' - email subject/list of subjects for various messages
- 'text'/'texts' - message text/set of texts for various messages

Before running the program please make sure all the files for the automated mailing are updated!
